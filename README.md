### What I learned

I practiced the html and css basics that i recently learned, so i'm proud of solving it. But actually i didn't manage to make it perfectly identical, because the final design has a little bigger gap between the text and the bottom of the box. So if anyone is reading this and know how to do it, i would appreciate some help :)

```css
.proud-of-this-css .main {
    display: flex; 
    flex-direction: column; 
    align-items: center;
    height: 500px;
    max-width: 336px;
    justify-content: center;
    margin-top: 20vh;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    border-radius: 5%;
    box-shadow: 1px 1px 20px 10px #d1dce8;
}
```
